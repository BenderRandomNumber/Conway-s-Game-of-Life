# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life is a celuar cellular automaton devised by the mathemitician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The Game is a Non-player game, with a set of rules dictating how the game plays out based on the inicial board. To start the game one must create an intial board then after that the board will evolve based of the rules.

The inicial starting board is a 2d grid of squares. Each square is either dead or alive, the normal way to defrencrate a square(cell) is to color alive cells black and dead cells white.

The board evolves by going through each cell determining if it will be dead or alive the next generation based of three rules.
